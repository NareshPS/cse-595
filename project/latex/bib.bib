    abstract = {More than twelve years have elapsed since the first public release of WEKA. In that time, the software has been rewritten entirely from scratch, evolved substantially and now accompanies a text on data mining [35]. These days, WEKA enjoys widespread acceptance in both academia and business, has an active community, and has been downloaded more than 1.4 million times since being placed on Source-Forge in April 2000. This paper provides an introduction to the WEKA workbench, reviews the history of the project, and, in light of the recent 3.6 stable release, briefly discusses what has been added since the last stable version (Weka 3.4) released in 2003.}

    abstract = {This short paper describes a novel technique for generating personalized tag recommendations for users of social book- marking sites such as del.icio.us. Existing techniques recom- mend tags on the basis of their popularity among the group of all users; on the basis of recent use; or on the basis of simple heuristics to extract keywords from the url being tagged. Our method is designed to complement these approaches, and is based on recommending tags from urls that are similar to the one in question, according to two distinct similarity metrics, whose principal utility covers complementary cases.}
